# 🏥 **Hospital Emergency Queue System (Doubly Linked List)**

---

## 📘 **Project Overview**
This project simulates a **Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Queue System** using a **Doubly Linked List** in **C++**.  
It efficiently manages patients based on **priority**, ensuring that **critical patients are treated first**, while normal walk-in patients wait their turn.  
The system allows **fast insertion and deletion** of patients at the beginning, end, or any position in the queue.

---

## 🎯 **Features / Operations**
| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🩺 `insertAtBeginning(patientID)` | Adds a **critical patient** at the start of the list. |
| 🚶 `insertAtEnd(patientID)` | Adds a **normal walk-in patient** at the end of the list. |
| ⚖️ `insertAtPosition(patientID, position)` | Inserts a patient at a specific **priority position** in the list. |
| 🏁 `deleteFromBeginning()` | Removes the **first patient** after treatment. |

---

## ⚙️ **Data Structure Used**
A **Doubly Linked List** is implemented, where each node contains:
- 🔢 `patientID` — Unique identifier for each patient  
- ⬅️ `prev` — Pointer to the previous patient  
- ➡️ `next` — Pointer to the next patient  

This structure allows **bi-directional traversal** and efficient real-time queue updates.

---

## 🧩 **Dry Run / Step-by-Step Example**

Starting from an **empty list**, the following operations are performed:

1️⃣ `insertAtEnd(101)`  
2️⃣ `insertAtEnd(102)`  
3️⃣ `insertAtBeginning(200)` *(Critical patient)*  
4️⃣ `insertAtPosition(150, 2)`  
5️⃣ `deleteFromBeginning()`  
6️⃣ `insertAtEnd(300)`

### ✅ **Final Output**
| Property | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| **Head** | 150 |
| **Tail** | 300 |
| **Forward Traversal** | 150 → 101 → 102 → 300 |
| **Backward Traversal** | 300 → 102 → 101 → 150 |

## 🧠 **Working Methodology**

1. Initialize an **empty ER list**.  
2. Add patients using insertion functions based on their urgency.  
3. Update **head**, **tail**, **prev**, and **next** pointers after each operation.  
4. Remove the first patient once treated.  
5. Ensure the list remains properly linked in both directions.  
6. Continue operations dynamically as new patients arrive.

## 📚 **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how a **Doubly Linked List** can effectively handle real-world queue management in hospital emergency systems.  
It ensures **fair, priority-based treatment**, supports **dynamic updates**, and maintains **efficient patient flow** in the ER.
